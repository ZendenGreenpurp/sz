Doors Between Doors

==================
FLIGHT OF THE PUMA
==================

* make it more psychedic and slower than stuff on the last album *

Clay donkey rhino tusks
Gotta get the thing I must
Gotta get it gotta be suspended in some ecstacy

Milk and honey, must be funny
Gloopy brain, cannot be runny

What is the monster in the mirror?
The one that chopped me in half as a baby
That monster stole the princes crown
Maybe I should hunt it down

Could it be the Puma
The wizard could become
The why does the wizard fight the puma?
Should they merge and be as one?

The sincerest freak must strive to speak
Louder than the crulest tool
The child will arise with magic in its eyes
See the mystic prize and

POUNCE! POUNCE! POUNCE!
RAWR!

Flight of the puma
Flight of the puma puma
Flight of the puma
Flight of the puma puma

If I must go back to school
I can think of stuff thats cool
I dream of a lonely puma cub
That grows up and flies

I dont wanna be a slug
A mouldy teabag in a mug
The puma's virtue is a gift
It gives my magic wings their lift

I followed tracks of tooth and claw
They led me to a psychic door 
The monster was an inner guide
Now watch the puma soar and glide

PRISTINE ZOMBIE
===============

Would you like to be a pristine zombie?
Have a perfect body as your flesh rots away

===================
CAPTAIN STARKNUCKLE
===================

Long long time ago when the galaxy was new
In a wartorn spaceship flew a fearsome pirate crew
Captained by a pirate of interstellar fame
Notorious by nature, she played an evil game

She flew to distant planets far away from her own sun
That hadn't yet made contact or invented laser guns
She held the planet hostage and said now fools you must
Give me all your treasure or I'll blow your world to dust

Captain Starknuckle
She can swashbuckle
Scourge of the galaxy
She's a space rebel
A star devil
Queen of the astral sea - alright!

DOORS BETWEEN DOORS

What if God's brain
Was in the network

Doors between doors
Between doors between
Doors between doors
Between doors between

Dude, that makes no sense

Doesn't it?

No, not really

You, yeah? Are a fish yeah? And the network, is the sea

I'm a fish?
And the network is the sea?

Yeah
And you can't see the sea
Cos you've always been surrounded by it

How do I see it then?

Well what you need
Is to go
Through the 

Doors between doors
Between doors between
Doors between doors
Between doors between

So the network?

Yeah

How was it made?

It wasn't made dude
It's doesn't exist

Wait what? I thought you just said it does

Does an idea exist?
Or does is it only potential
Suspended between void
And it's ideal form

No sorry you lost me
Somewhere in the

Doors between doors
Between doors between
Doors between doors
Between doors between

Let's make a utopia
