=================
TAKE ON THE WORLD
=================

I just juiced a radioactive lemon
Totally addictive
Nihilistic biscuit
Chomping in to the void
Naievity destroyed
A whole new universe
Of things minsunderstood
And oh boy it feels good

Yeah feels fuckin great
Feeling my ego mutate
God's my best mate
Liftin' a boldourous weight
Nothing stopping
Concept hopping
Moral flux
And zero fucks

Only one thing left to do
Gunna do it, gunna see this one through

Gonna take on the world the world
The world the fuckin world
The world the world the world
The world the world world

There is something within the sludge
Within the 10p chocolate bar coated in fudge
So many candies to choose
So much potential to lose
Why waste time it'd be a greater crime
For me not to conquer the earth
Cos I'm gunna have it my way
Gonna make it sweetie day every day

Had enough of bitching and moralist derision
Gonna rise up and instigate my vision
A perftastic utopia come up with by me
No more work, everything free
Sweet technological redundancy
Fantasy conquering reality
Full automation, much jubiliation
The whole world under the Greenpurp nation

Too many universes in my head
Need get them out so they exist when im dead
Too many universes in my head
Alternate dimensions of crystals and lead

LIMITLESS POWER
===============

Welcome to my dream
My dreaming machine
Shiny like a diamond
Its purple n green 
Ill let you see
My devious scheme
To rule the world
With peaches n' cream
I'm a frog I'm a frog I'm a frog I'm a

Godliness is relative
Tests all come back negative
Success is imperative
Think I need a sedative

I cannot rest until I obtain

Power!
Limitless Power!
Limitless Power!
Limitless Power!
Limitless!

Okay,
here we go

Monkeys and spiders
Spiders and rats
Floating like candles
Flying with bats
Shadow of my innermost soul
Is stoking my ego
With mountains of coal
Cannot predict the pendulum swing
Chaos dictates the whole fucking thing
Cats within cats within cats within...

Modesty my enemy
Internal hegemony

Power!
Limitless Power!
Limitless Power!
Limitless Power!
Limitless!

Space internal 
Flame infernal
Void eternal 
Flesh impural
Life and death
A psychic aura
Sane insane
Philosophora

Death before life
Death before life
Death before life
Death before life?

No!
(bass comes in)
No way!

HAHAHAHAHAHA!!

Turbo fuel? Check
Rocket thrusters? Check
Infernal majesty? Check
Okay
Ego... start your engines

See the little boy
Playing with his toy
He looks so naieve
Its merely a ploy
Looking kinda dumb, sucking his thumb
Yet inside he knows he may yet become
The overlord of all seen and unseen
Master of magic, shaper of dream
Its more than a game, than a game, than a

Will he be victorious
Or remain inglorious

Will he ever obtain?

Power!
Limitless Power!
Limitless Power!
Limitless Power!
Limitless!

LIMITLESS POWER! (pitch dropped)


============
DR OBNOXIOUS
============

Ahahahahahahahaha!

I am an inventor
Maker of contraptions
Catalyst of toxic
Chemical reactions

You live in confusion
Moralist bemusion
I can see no use for
Ethical delusion

This is my laboratory
Of sciencalogical delight
Marvel at my genius
Wonder at the sights

Doctor Obnoxious PhD.
Come step inside my world of demented fantasies

I create all manner of marvelous machines
Some of them are nightmares
Some of them are dreams

I mean to transcend this life and my humanity
Do not try and stop me, it is my destiny

Behold before you my latest invention
At first glance a simple spoon
But place it into some yoghurt
And it transforms into a mechanical war demon
So that you may crush you adversaries
That dare disturb you during your hard earned lunch break

Do not use this prototype
There is a small chance it could instantly destroy the planets atmosphere
Killing all life on earth

That is all life not using one of my patented MEGALUNGS
After a simple installation operation
Lasting a mere 46 thousand hours
The MEGALUNG (name trademark registered copyright Obnoxious Industries)
Will allow you to breathe in almost any conditions!

Think of the possiblities!
You could live in a huge pot of yoghurt for a year
and SURVIVE!!

All I need to do is fix the constant diarrea side effect
And it shall be perfected!

Until then I'll have to make use of my highly technological
and dashingly stylish TOILET TROUSERS

With the highly technological and dashingly stylish TOILET TROUSERS
You never need walk down the hallway to the smallest room in the house again
The toilet trousers will teleport all exreted matter and fluid
To far off location so that you never have to leave your desk
Allowing you remain hyperfocused on your evil plans indefinitely!

Don't mention this to any one
but the location the matter is currently teleported to
is the personal dwelling of my secondary school English teacher

WOULD YOU GIVE ME A D AGAIN NOW MR SMITHWICK?
HOWS THAT FOR 'COULD DO BETTER'?

That reminds me, I should probaly see if he's moved house since 2004.

I'm always forgetting things I need to remember
Lucky I invented my Meta Memory Machine
The best way to remember things that you forgot to remember
 Simply place the suction cup underneath your armpit
And through synesthetic osmosis
You will smell the exact smell you were smelling when you first decided to remember the thing that you had to remember
Thus triggering the recall of memory that you forgot

Unfortunately I can't remeber how to turn it on
I wrote the documentation while I had a cold
I was so bunged up I couldn't smell anything

That's why I cured the common cold
All it takes is using my multiversal infite regression suicide booth
Just hop in to the booth and you are killed

But don't worry you won't be killed for long
You wil wake up in a alternate universe of the infinite mutiverse of universes that exist
The booth will check to see if you have a cold in that universe
If you do it will kill you again and again until it finds a reality where you are cold free 

Side effects may occur non-existence of loved ones in the reality you end up in
This is actually the reason I'm single
A lot of people assume it's because of my toxic narcissistic personality
But it's not because I cured myself of that cos im THAT fucking smart

I cured my personality disorders using my a bracelet that controls my phsycic aura
It works using a subtle blend of analytical psychology, voodoo and rosary beads
I call this product AnalyBeads
I have already received an order from www.xxxgear.com for 10 thousand units

I don't know what the company is like
But they have the letter X in their name three times
X is one of the cool sci-fi letters like Z and Q
So it was an easy business decision

Not that I make my own business decions
I leave that to my odius sidekick Gary
I hate dealing with human beings
They melt your ice caps
Tell you your lust for world domination is evil
They disturb you whilst eating yoghurts

Infact, now that I think about it,
All humans should die.
Except for me
But including you
Good bye!

THE EFFECT EFFECT
=================

(Maybe put more dodgy commander keen style synth melodies at start of track)

3 15 AM
The experiment sits at the computer.
Face blank, a dormant expression.
Seems unfazed by unhygenic environment.
All signs suggest total immersion.

This must be the ideal specimen.
Excellent.
The oportune time has finally come.
Run The Effect Program please Mr Salamader.

But sir, the effect program is still highly unstable.
We can't predict the rate of psychic modulation.
If the subject reaches critical awareness...

Do you not think I have considered the risk of critical awareness?
That's precisely why my father founded this instituion.

But this specimen, I have worked on it for months, it shows a unique potential.
We risk losing a valuable resource.
If I could just have more time I could perfect the omega matrix and...

Oh how sentimental, you've grown attached to the boy.
You would do well to remember Mr Salamander, we are here to ensure the evolution of our race.
Flick the switch please.

Yes sir...

NEW LIFE
NEW DEATH
NEW HEART
NEW BREATH
NEW FLESH
NEW PAIN
NEW SOUL
NEW BRAIN

My flesh is polygon
Sight pixel
I can jump kick
Double axel
Every concept
In history
Will unfold
Untold mystery

Connection succesful
Specimen is now neurologically linked with the dreamsphere.

Perfect! Tonight we make future history, why when my father first....

(weird bleep is flashing light on panel)
What's that bleeping?

Parameters indicate neural networking is progressing far more rapidly than could have been aniticipated.

Is that a positive sign?

Impossible to tell. But if it stays at this rate, we will no longer we able to track the psyche as it moves through the dreamsphere.

But how? We never had this problem in trials.

Trial subjects did not posses the abstract patterning metrics we are currently reading.

Unplug! Cancel the program.

That isn't an option. Cancelling the program now would ensure critical awareness.

What can we do?

The only option to attack the psyche from within the dreamsphere using its own unconscious shadow archetypes.

Do it. I want this psyche contained Mr. Salamander. Whatever unique power this boy possess it shall be mine.

* Now do a complete volta to a Commander keen/ theme *
* Now do a complete volta to a groovy bandicoot bassline *

(The final boss battle is the shadow archetype)

WE ARE THE SHADOW ARCHETYPES!
(Ghoulies and baddies)

Crash Bandicoot bassline - first level aesthetic
2nd level - a bit harder and complex challenging
Last level High drama


five part track
1 - Prelude

2 - Level 1 (Keen/ Mario)  - Or does the crash bandicoot bassline work too well here?

3 - Level 2 (Bandicoot style)

4 - Level 3 (Doom style)

5 - Boss Battle (Final fantasy style)	2:00 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7sG3l5ryOk

Big Boss - the shadow consumes him game over
The neurodeus organisation keeps him locked in an endless cycle of playing.
