==============
HYPERMETAMANIA
==============

Above and beyond
The omega zone
There lived a humble genius
Named Squidgeyboy Malone
Malone thought about thoughts
as he smoked his pipe alone
His lights always on
but nobody home

Deep into subconsciousness
this weird fishy swam
and when he saw the oceans depth
his conscious state went WHAM

*Sudden music stop *
*announcer: "This is what it felt like*
*Weird ass music plays*
*Back to first style*

It hit him like a car crash
The chaos of psychic being
He used to wonder why some
Didnt philosophise like he
And now he knows that if they did
They are right to turn and flee

Such a sad apotheosis
An ungoogleable self diagnosis
Nothing could be planer
A classic case of hypermetamania

Dont mess around with concepts kids
They're best off left alone
Just take the world we see as read
Lest ye tiny mind be blown
