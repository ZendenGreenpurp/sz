The Greenpurp album formula
---------------------------
All albums have an intangible theme.
To name the theme would be to negate it (!)

The albums follow the same structure:

1. Kick ass track - showcasing what the sonic style developed for the album can do
2. A level deeper - taking the momentum and breaking further, weirder thematic ground
3. Character track - a track sung about an individual that embodies the theme. Sonically agressive.
4. Hit single - a wry pop song on the theme with pop focus of unguarded emotional confession
5. Freak out - an instrumental pushing the sonic style beyond its limits
6. Adventure track - the epic where the different sub themes are tied together and played out
