Kommander Krunchem
------------------

Master.
That was what they used to call me.
Now I call myself slime.

I am one with the slime I once sought to purge from this dimension.
The dimension I once held in my arms like a sleeping baby.
A baby I could have nurtured or murdered.

I dangle on the verge of oblivion.
I can feel the winds of the void on my decrepit flesh.
The last thread will soon be cut.

Before I plunge into abyss.
My thoughts turn to my conquest of reality.
And of how close I came to total unity.

--Drop (Alice Cooper style)

Satisfaction, you got none.
Meet your new leader whos gunna get you some.
He's a true world hero.
A prodigal son.
A weak defeated people's champion

Kommander Krunchem
The power of a God
Kommander Krunchem
You know you want him baby
